# 🌃 YouTube Pivot: Night Drive
**Goal:** Replace the noise of the day with sophisticated, eclectic instrumental music and cinematic visuals.

### 🔗 Phase 1: The Search Blast
Open these results and let a video play for at least 5 minutes.
* [My Analog Journal - Turkish Funk / Brazilian Jazz](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=my+analog+journal)
* [Terminal V - Dark Disco & Night Drive Beats](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=terminal+v+night+drive)
* [Lofi Girl - Synthwave / Chill Radio](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lofi+girl)

### 📺 Phase 2: Channel Subscriptions
Subscribe to the 3 masters of the "Eclectic Instrumental" vibe:
1. [My Analog Journal](https://www.youtube.com/@MyAnalogJournal) (The gold standard for global vinyl, jazz, and funk)
2. [Lofi Girl](https://www.youtube.com/@LofiGirl) (The foundation of focus and relaxation)
3. [Cercle](https://www.youtube.com/@Cercle) (Atmospheric electronic sets in stunning global locations)

### 🧹 Phase 3: History Cleanup
Remove any "Pop Music" or "Top 40" videos from your watch history. This forces the "Up Next" algorithm to prioritize the sophisticated instrumental clusters you've just seeded.
