# 🏛️ TikTok Pivot: Renaissance Human
**Goal:** Train your FYP to show you history, literature, and the "Dark Academia" aesthetic.

### 🔗 Phase 1: High-Signal Follows
Follow these creators. Watch their latest video and **Favorite** it.
* **[@arthistorytea](https://www.tiktok.com/@arthistorytea)** - Deep dives into the secret lives of famous artists.
* **[@museumofmodernart](https://www.tiktok.com/@museumofmodernart)** - MoMA's official behind-the-scenes content.
* **[@the_met](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_met)** - The Met's official short-form history.

### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Academic" Loop
Search for `#darkacademia` or `#arthistory`. Pick a video explaining a painting or a poem and **let it loop twice.** Rewatches on educational content are the strongest "Niche" signal on TikTok.

### 🧹 Phase 3: The Low-Culture Swipe
The second you see a "clickbait" trend or a loud, low-effort meme, **swipe up instantly.** You are teaching TikTok that you are a person of high-quality taste.
