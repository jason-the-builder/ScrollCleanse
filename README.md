> **"Your attention is your most valuable asset. Stop letting bad algorithms waste it."**

## 🛠 The 3-Step Workflow

### Step 1: The Clean Slate (The Scrub) 🧹
Before planting new seeds, you must clear the "mud" from your canvas.

## Step 2: Choose Your Archetype 🌱
Read the descriptions below to find the "vibe" you want to pivot toward.

#### 🏗️ Category A: High Performance & Learning
* **Founder Mode:** High-energy building. SaaS, Startups, and Venture Capital. Moving from "Consumer" to "Creator."
* **Open Ivy:** Turning your feed into a world-class university. MIT, Stanford, and Yale lectures. Reclaiming deep focus.
* **Stoic Fortress:** Calm, detached, and disciplined. Marcus Aurelius meets Minimalism. Breaking "outrage-addiction."

#### 🌿 Category B: Lifestyle & Vitality
* **The Blue Zone:** Longevity, functional fitness, and "living to 100." Focusing on health as a long-term investment.
* **The Master Chef:** Moving from "fast food" to "food mastery." Culinary science and world-class techniques.
* **Off-Grid Escape:** Cabin building, foraging, and minimalist living. Reminding yourself of the physical world.

#### ✨ Category C: Inspiration & Aesthetic
* **Golden Retriever:** Maximum wholesome. Puppy rescues and heartwarming stories. A "digital hug" to break a negative mood.
* **Future Shock:** AI, Space-X, and Robotics. Replacing "fear" of the future with "awe" at the frontier of tech.
* **Renaissance Human:** Art history, classical music, and philosophy. Feeling cultured and well-rounded.
* **Night Drive:** A sophisticated auditory reset. Instrumental jazz, funk, and global lo-fi beats.

## Step 4: Guard Your Feed (The Maintenance) 🛡️
1. **The "Not Interested" Rule:** For the first 48 hours, be aggressive. If a video doesn't fit your new vibe, hit "Not Interested" immediately.
2. **Search is a Signal:** Use your search bar to "vote" for what you want to see.
3. **Weekly Check-ins:** Run a "mini-scrub" once a week to keep the noise away.
