# 🏛️ YouTube Pivot: Stoic Fortress
**Goal:** Turn your background noise from news and drama into philosophy and calm.

### 🔗 Phase 1: The Search Blast
Open these results and watch at least 3 minutes of a high-quality video.
* [Marcus Aurelius Meditations Full Audiobook](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=marcus+aurelius+meditations+audiobook)
* [Vox Stoica - Epictetus Enchiridion](https://www.youtube.com/@VoxStoica)
* [Stoic Way - Calm and Resilience 2026](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stoic+way+philosophy)

### 📺 Phase 2: Channel Subscriptions
Subscribe to these 3 guardians of calm:
1. [Daily Stoic](https://www.youtube.com/@DailyStoic)
2. [Einzelgänger](https://www.youtube.com/@Einzelganger) (Excellent for minimalism and focus)
3. [Vox Stoica](https://www.youtube.com/@VoxStoica) (Direct readings of the ancient texts)

### 🧹 Phase 3: History Scrub
Go to [Google My Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/product/youtube) and delete any history relating to "viral news" or "political commentary." This removes the "outrage" trigger from your feed.
