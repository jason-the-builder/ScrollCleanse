**Goal:** Train your FYP to show you functional movement, healthy aging, and vibrant community life.

### 🔗 Phase 1: High-Signal Follows
Follow these creators. Watch their latest video to the end and **Favorite** it.

### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Longevity" Search
Search for `#longevity` or `#functionalmovement`. Pick a video of an older person doing something active (like yoga or hiking) and **watch it twice.** This signals an interest in "Long-term health."

### 🧹 Phase 3: The Instant Swipe
As soon as you see a "What I eat in a day" video that feels restrictive or "diet-culture" heavy, **swipe away instantly.** We want to see abundance and vitality, not restriction.
