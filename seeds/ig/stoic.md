# 🏛️ Instagram Pivot: Stoic Fortress
**Goal:** Replace "FOMO" and comparison with internal resilience and calm.

### 🔗 Phase 1: High-Signal Profile Visits
Visit these profiles. Like their 3 most recent text-based posts. 
* **[@dailystoic](https://www.instagram.com/dailystoic/)** (The hub for modern Stoicism)
* **[@dailystoicpodcast](https://www.instagram.com/dailystoicpodcast/)** (Deep dives into resilience)
* **[@ryanholiday](https://www.instagram.com/ryanholiday/)** (Stoic author and mental model expert)

### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Stillness" Signal
Search for `#stoicism` or `#mindfulness`. Find 5 minimalist, text-based posts and **Save** them. This tells IG you want your feed to look like a book, not a billboard.

### 🧹 Phase 3: The "Ego" Scrub
Go to your Explore page. If you see luxury "flexing," loud memes, or celebrity drama:
1. Long-press the post.
2. Tap **"Not Interested."**
3. This is essential for Stoic Fortress; you must be ruthless with your attention.
