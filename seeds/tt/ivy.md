# 🎓 TikTok Pivot: Open Ivy (Edu-Tok)
**Goal:** Make your "For You Page" a source of daily micro-learning and academic curiosity.

### 🔗 Phase 1: High-Signal Follows
Follow these academic creators. Watch their latest video and **save it to a "Learning" collection.**
* **[@bigthink](https://www.tiktok.com/@bigthink)** - Expert ideas from world-class thinkers.
* **[@veritasium](https://www.tiktok.com/@veritasium)** - High-level science and physics explained clearly.
* **[@tedtoks](https://www.tiktok.com/@tedtoks)** - Short-form insights from TED speakers.

### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Academic" Search
Search for `#LearnOnTikTok` or `#Physics`. Pick a video and **watch it to the very end.** Completion rate is the most important signal for TikTok to know you're actually learning.

### 🧹 Phase 3: The Swipe-Away
The second a video starts with a "trending song" or "POV" meme, **swipe up.** Teach the algorithm that your time is for knowledge, not trends.
