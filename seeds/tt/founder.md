### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Rewatch" Signal
Search for `#buildinpublic` or `#saasfounder`. Pick a video you like and **let it loop twice**. Rewatches are the #1 signal to the TikTok algorithm that you want more of this content.

### 🧹 Phase 3: The "Instant Swipe"
TikTok measures how many milliseconds you stay on a video. The second you see a "viral challenge" or "drama" video, **swipe away instantly.** This tells the algorithm your interest in junk is zero.
