# 🔪 TikTok Pivot: The Master Chef
**Goal:** Train your FYP to show you professional kitchen workflows, ingredient knowledge, and advanced techniques.

### 🔗 Phase 1: High-Signal Follows
Follow these pro-level creators. Watch a video to the end and **Favorite** it to anchor your feed.
* **[@straker.s](https://www.tiktok.com/@straker.s)** (Thomas Straker - Focus on elevated ingredients and butter/sauce technique)
* **[@andycooks](https://www.tiktok.com/@andycooks)** (Andy Hearnden - Professional chef techniques for home cooks)
* **[@chef_koutsopoulosleonidas](https://www.tiktok.com/@chef_koutsopoulosleonidas)** (Professional kitchen energy and high-level execution)

### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Technique" Loop
Search for `#knifeskills` or `#frenchcooking`. Pick a video showing a specific cut or a mother sauce. **Let it loop twice.** The algorithm interprets rewatches as "educational intent."

### 🧹 Phase 3: The Viral Filter
If a video starts with someone throwing food or using "stunt" ingredients (like 10 lbs of melted cheese), **swipe away instantly.** Teach TikTok you are here for the craft, not the clout.
